# AAVE-Escrow-dApps



Smart contract, â€˜Vanilla Escrowâ€™, facilitates a simple escrow service whereby, once funds have been deposited to the smart contract, only the arbiter can approve the withdrawal of said funds.

Building upon this, smart contracts 'AAVE Eth Escrow' and 'AAVE Dai Escrow', allow the depositor to earn interest whilst the funds are in escrow, through utilisation of AAVEâ€™s lending pools. Once approved by the arbiter, the beneficiary receives the initial amount deposited to the smart contract, whilst any interest earned is sent to the depositor.
